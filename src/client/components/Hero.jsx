        Happy Tails Rescue Hub was created for the purpose of streamlining the
        process of connecting adoptable dogs with their fur-ever families. As
        avid dog lovers and supporters of the rescue community, our aim is to
        increase exposure for local rescues by providing a convenient central
        hub for those who are looking to adopt a furry friend. üêæ{" "}
